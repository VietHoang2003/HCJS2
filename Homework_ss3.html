<font size="5%">A <b>multi-tier enterprise application</b> consists of two types of objects: <b>application 
logic components</b> and <b>persistent data objects</b>. Application logic components 
represent actions and define methods that perform common tasks such as calculating the order price, customer credit card billing, and so on. Session beans model the 
application logic components as they contain the logic to perform the application 
tasks.<br> 
It is easy and simple to manage the business data present in large organizations as 
objects rather than as relational rows in a database. Business data when treated as 
objects are easy to handle and manage as they are compact in nature.<br> 
Entities are not associated with only EJBs and can be used in
<b>Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE)</b> environment. The differences between an Entity 
and a Session bean are as follows:<br>
<li>Entities have a client-visibility and a persistent identity that is distinct from 
    their object reference. Each entity is distinct from the other because of their 
    identities. Clients can use identities to pass the reference of an entity to other 
    applications. However, this is not possible with Session beans.</li><br>
<li>Entity bean cannot be accessed remotely, whereas Session beans can be 
    accessed locally as well as remotely.</li><br>
<li>Entity’s lifetime is not dependent on the application’s lifetime. Entity bean 
    have a much longer lifetime than a client’s session as it depends on how long 
    the data is present in the database.</li><br> 
<li>Entities represent data in a storage that is permanent as well as fault-tolerant 
    and hence, they are long lasting and can survive application server or 
    database crash. This data can be reconstructed in the memory. Hence, it can 
    be said that entity is an in-memory representation of persistent data that:</li><br>
    <li>Can be loaded from persistent store and its field populated with the 
    stored data</li><br>
    <li>Can be modified in-memory to change the data values </li><br>
    <li>Can be saved and correspondingly database is updated</li><br><font>
